I"p<p>London is a great city full of amazing people, with all their differences and similarities. And the only thing they have in common is: they live in London, and it’s not made of rubber!
Each of us needs our own piece of private space, and some of that space here is… unusual.
Unusual in a good way, in a curious way or might just… you know, benefit from demolition.</p>

<p>The latter is what my story is about.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a not so standard apartment in London, or looking at how to get rid of it, please follow along.</p>

I have an imaginary friend, Fred. He just moved to London from another Solar system and is looking for a flat or house to rent. 
As a person who is almost a native Londoner (5 years of residency is quite a lifetime here!) I am trying to help him.</p>

<p>Here are some options Fred and I found on popular real estate websites.</p>

<p>Lot number one!</p>

<p>If only our lyrical hero grew up to become a Policeman (or, alternatively, had Tritanopia) he might have been happy (or at least calm) in this kitchen.
An alarming place for the rest of us to be!</p>

<p>London bedrooms are known to be ridiculously small. Properties are advertised in bedrooms. “2-bedroom apartment” could consist of a kitchen, living room, two double bedrooms and a garden, or it could just be a tiny little kitchen that has been a corridor in Victorian times and two rooms, the only thing that fits in is a bed that has been magically assembled inside.</p>

<p>As a kid I often dreamed of a room where the floor would be soft and I can sleep wherever I want.
Thanks gods (of laughter) today I found my perfect place!</p>
