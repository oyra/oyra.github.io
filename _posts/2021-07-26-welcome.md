London is a great city full of amazing people, with all their differences and similarities. And the only thing they have in common is: they live in London, and it’s not made of rubber!
Each of us needs our own piece of private space, and some of that space here is… unusual.
Unusual in a good way, in a curious way or might just… you know, benefit from demolition.

The latter is what my story is about.

If you are looking for a not so standard apartment in London, or looking at how to get rid of it, please follow along.

I have an imaginary friend, Fred. He just moved to London from another Solar system and is looking for a flat or house to rent. 
As a person who is almost a native Londoner (5 years of residency is quite a lifetime here!) I am trying to help him.

Here are some options Fred and I found on popular real estate websites.

Lot number one!

If only our lyrical hero grew up to become a Policeman (or, alternatively, had Tritanopia) he might have been happy (or at least calm) in this kitchen.
An alarming place for the rest of us to be!

London bedrooms are known to be ridiculously small. Properties are advertised in bedrooms. “2-bedroom apartment” could consist of a kitchen, living room, two double bedrooms and a garden, or it could just be a tiny little kitchen that has been a corridor in Victorian times and two rooms, the only thing that fits in is a bed that has been magically assembled inside.

As a kid I often dreamed of a room where the floor would be soft and I can sleep wherever I want.
Thanks gods (of laughter) today I found my perfect place!
