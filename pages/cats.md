A boy<br/>
Features: flegmatic, cutest laying on his back, funniest chin, loudest purring, loves stroking. Very calm and relaxed<br/>
Will easily fall asleep in your hands... or wherever!

A girl<br/>
Features: sad eyes, loads of energy! Best climber and runner, fastest toy catcher ever (got it from her mum!), extremely playful!<br/>
She started running immediately when she was born<br/>
Loves being stroked on her forehead but only after she's tired of running and got back from the ceiling.
She is the only kitten who is very vocal about things: squeaking about what she doesn't like or needs (although she does it less recently)


<h1>Quattro</h1>

A sweet sweet boy
<br/>
The fluffy one! Round eyes, cutest purring.<br/>
Features: the softest fur ever; naive eyes; cutest creature, especially when on his back. Will purrr and fall asleep in your hands
Features: emits cuteness constantly.
He started making funny sounds when playing recently. Do you remember in "Jurassic park" there was a dino making urrrr sounds and spitting acid afterwards? That's the sound. But without acid :)

<h1>Quinta</h1>
{% include image-gallery.html folder="/cats/Quinta" %}
A boy
<br/>
Explorer! 
A tiny bit selfish and doesn't like to share so for now we think he wants to be the only cat in the household (but let's see, his siblings are still trying to change it)
<br/>
Features: extremely smart and curious; silky fur; great climber!
Started exploring right after he was born
